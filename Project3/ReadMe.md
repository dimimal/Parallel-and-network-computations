This is a project about COO Sparce Matrix multiplication,
implemented with serial algorithm and parallel using MPI.
The parallel executable runs with run.sh script on Cluster
using Sun Grid Engine with the following command:

qsub -pe orte x run.sh x N

x: Argument for precessing nodes
N: The dimension of NxN sparse Matrix
